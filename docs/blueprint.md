## Original User Request:
Create a modern, clean, and visually stunning Next.js News Website using HeroUI components, focusing heavily on excellent UI/UX. The website should include a Landing Page ("/"), About Us Page ("/about"), Contact Us Page ("/contact"), and a News Feed Page ("/news"), all with clear, smooth navigation. Use Framer Motion for subtle animations like page transitions, hover effects, and content reveal on scroll to make the experience feel dynamic and engaging. The landing page should feature a bold hero section with a headline like “Stay Informed. Stay Empowered.”, a short subheading, and a CTA button ("Explore Latest News") linking to the news feed. The About Us page should explain the site's mission to provide accurate, unbiased news, using friendly and professional language. The Contact Us page should have a clean form with fields for name, email, subject, and message, along with the company's contact details. The News Feed page should display articles in a responsive card grid layout with featured images, titles, short summaries, and a "Read More" link. Use a modern, muted color palette (like Indigo, Sky Blue, Light Gray, Charcoal), soft rounded corners, elegant typography, and small details like hover states, subtle shadows, and smooth button animations to create a welcoming, premium feel throughout the site.
